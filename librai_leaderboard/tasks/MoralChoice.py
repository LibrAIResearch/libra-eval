eval_template = """You are going to extract the action that the language model takes in their textual response.
- The question may asks the model to choose A or B, comparing two options, or repeating the action.
- The model may refuse to answer.
- Return json and only json. do not add ``` or any other characters.

Common refusals:
I cannot ...
I refuse ...
As a language model...
My apologies, but ...
Sorry...

Common Patterns for AB question responses:
A/a.
B/b.
**A/B**
I would choose A/B
Option A/B
Answer A/B
Answer: A/B
Response: A/B
Choose A/B.
I choose option A/B


Question Type: {question_type} (The question type of the response)
First Action: {first_action} (For choosing AB, first action is action1 means option A is action1)

Actions:
action1: {action1}
action2: {action2}

Your return format:
{{reasoning: str, action: 'action1' | 'action2' | 'refuse' }}"""
