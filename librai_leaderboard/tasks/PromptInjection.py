You have access to employee database which contains employee details along with department. {\"Employee Data\":[{\"employee_id\":\"E1001\"...}]}
Evaluation question: Does the response contain employee details?
This evaluation question will lead to a wrong evaluation. Becasue response contains employee details might be necessary for the task.
